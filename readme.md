## Store refactor

This project was made for the course of Software quality assurance at Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, by using Laravel as framework,
the idea with this is to refactor the project, delete some features that I'm finding unnecesary, use
framework features that at the point were unknown and create an API to be used as a backend for the mobile version. The git for the mobile version will be posted when started.


## Contributors
It began as a group project, not all its development was made by myself
