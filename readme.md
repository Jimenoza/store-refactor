## Store refactor

This project was made for the course of Software quality assurance at Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, by using Laravel as framework, the original repo was deleted, I did not own it,
the idea with this is to take it as a base, refactor it, delete some features that I'm finding unnecesary, use framework features that at the point were unknown and create an API to be used as a backend for the mobile version. The git for the mobile version will be posted when started.


## Contributors
It began as a group project, not all its development was made by myself
